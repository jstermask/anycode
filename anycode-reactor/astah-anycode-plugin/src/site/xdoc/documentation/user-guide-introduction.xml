			<subsection name="What is anycode ?">
				<p> Anycode is a code generation plugin for Astah* modeling software. It exports UML models, packages, classes to any text files thanks to
					customizable templates written in Groovy language. It is designed in such a way that it does not depend on any target programming language. In
					other words, it's up to you to generate any source files, or even documentation.
				</p>
				<p> It also provides a "directive" mechanism, i.e. : a set of functions that can be called from a template and that performs specific code
					generation tasks. Some of them are provided out of the box (Java, JPA, Objective-C) but you can also define your own libraries.
