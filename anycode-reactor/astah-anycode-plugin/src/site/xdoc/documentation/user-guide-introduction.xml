			<subsection name="What is anycode ?">
				<p>
					Anycode is a code generation plugin for Astah* modeling
					software.

					exports UML models, packages, classes to text files thanks to
					customizable
					templates written in Groovy language.

			<subsection name="Why an Astah* Plugin ?">
				<p>
					Astah* is a user friendly UML modeling software, that enables to
					design domain models efficiently. Moreover, it provides a free
					(community) version as well as a free
					SDK to extend it. Finally,
					even if XMI format is exported by most UML softwares, it is now
					well known that there is no actual standard as each vendor provides
					its own XMI representation. As a consequence, generating code from
					XMI files exported from any UML tool would be a nightmare to
					implement.
				</p>
				<p>
					Those are the reasons why anycode is targetted to Astah* through
					a plugin.

			<subsection name="How it works ?">
				<p>The main objective of this plugin is to make code generation customizable, and easy.</p>
